Description: Take a dataset in the form of a dataframe and change column names 
    to manageable and syntactically valid coded variables names. Used in 
    conjunction with the 'tm' and 'SnowballC' package, this package will 
    create shortened and simple column names using natural language processing to 
    attempt to maintain variable meaning. With a pre-specified max character 
    length (default = 15), user can also decide to shorten variables to a 
    desired length. A reference vector is created (coderef) which displays the
    transformed column names and the original column name, as well as the class 
    of data for each column.
